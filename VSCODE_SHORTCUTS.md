Przy twożeniu pliku możemy wpisać folder/folder/plik.js

Change name acrose files
RMB na nazwie np. funkcji klikamy Find all references (Shift + Alt + F12) następnie RMB na nazwie i wybieramy Rename symbol (F2)

Ctrl + Shift + E to focus on the file sidebar, and use arrow keys to navigate through them.
When a file is selected, Ctrl + \ to open it in a new split window.
You can change the focus between split window groups with Ctrl + 1/2, etc.
Ctrl + Tab, or Alt + 1/2/3 etc. to navigate through currently opened files in the currently focused window.
Ctrl + W to close the currently opened file in the currently focused window.

2. Ctrl + B -> Toggle File Explorer
3. Ctrl + J -> Alternate for Ctrl + ` (Toggle Terminal)
4. ALT + Number -> Change Active Tab Windows
5. Ctrl + Shift + P -> Direct Access to Command Runner for VS Code

alt + left key : goes backwards to the last file or line you visited
crtl + shift + f : finds all in your whole project/directory
F12 : goes to defenition
crtl + alt + up/down keys : sets cursor on multiple subsequent lines

instead of doing CRTL + P and then typing an > you can just do CRTL + SHIFT + P. Flows much better

ctrl + ` -> To toggle the terminal
shift+ctrl+E -> Toggle Explorer
shift+ctrl+G -> Source Control Toggle

VERY IMPORTANT COMMAND THAT SAVED ME YEARS OF MY LIFE "lol"
Place your cursor on a <div> then press ctrl+p, and then type balance(outward)
THIS command will drive you where the div close! (Make this keybord shortcut)
THEN make also a keybord shortcut the command -> balance(inward)
NOW you can select blocks of code(If you want press again balance outward or inward to mark the parent or the child block)

Ctrl+Q

CTRL + Tab" to shuffle between opened documents.

Pro tip: once the focus is on the Terminal area (CTRL+`), you can hit CTRL+SHIFT+5 to create another terminal pane split vertically.

1. tip for renaming anything in all of our code there's an shortcut just press F2 key.
   and just type new name of your thing.

2. to delete a whole line without selecting just press SHIFT + DELETE

3. to delete a word in forward direction press Ctrl + Delete.This will delete the word after the cursor.

4. to delete words in backward direction then just press Ctrl + Backspace to delete it.

5. press F1 or fn + F1 to access command palllete

use " ctrl + pageUp/pageDown " to toggle between those files

One good way to keep your files organized is by pinning tabs by "right click" -> "pin" (Ctrl+K Shift+Enter), pinned tabs have a number of useful features to help mark files that are important to you.

Ctrl + Space to trigger suggestion

Close all the tabs at once: cmd+k+w
Open any project/directory (already opened once): ctrl+r

Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + O for member variables and functions

Shift + Alt + A -- Create a block comment (useful for languages that have specific block comment syntax that varies from inline comments).

ctrl+shift+e to toggle file side bar

ALT+F12 or CTRL+(click) which is described as "peak-definition".

CTRL+SHIFT+T reopens the recently closed tabs/files in VSCode. Also works in chrome, not sure in other browsers.

Pressing Alt + Shift + o in js projects will remove unused import. (optimise imports)

to write the width or height in css
you just type h for height and w for width
for example a div with a width of 16px

just type w16 and enter

Pro Tip: After selecting a text, instead of doing Ctrl + D to select more like it, You can use Ctrl + F2 to select all in that file. Then edit it all.

you can use autocomplete in a super-advanced way, VScode has this built-in
basically, instead of having to write a long piece of code that's repetitive, you can do it instead with few letters
for example "display: flex;" can become "df", this is a simple but really useful way to write faster!

Windows: Shift + Alt + <- / ->
Place the cursor in the middle of a string and start expanding. It will firstly select the word and then will be gradually adding surroundings to the selection: firstly the whole string, then the quotes, then the brackets, then the object, then object's brackets and so on and so forth - feels like AI and can save a lot of time.

Ctrl + Alt + <- / -> przenosi aktualny plik na prawo (split screen)

put a cursor on a text and ctrl+shift+L to create a cursor in every repeated text.
ctrl+shift+5 slipt the terminal

alt + z toggle on and off line breaking

FOLD Code with SHIFT+Left Click on the folding icons. First time it'll fold all its foldable childrens, second one will fold the parent (element clicked) and the third one will unfold all. Perferct for Class definitions (fold all methods), JSON objects/files (fold all properties), YAML/XML/HTML files...

Matching parentheses/brace/square-bracket: CTRL + SHIFT + \

ctrl + tab = Move between your files opened

To scroll a file like a pro: ALT + mouse up/down. It'll increase the scroll speed.

Auto tag renaming is now built into Vs Code, just enable it in the settings.

CTRL + H : Replace

My favorite VSCode Trick is command + enter. This key I use nonstop, it automatically makes a new line below the line my cursor was. If the line already has closing tags I can just use it and it'll spawn a new line in between the 2 tags. I don't even have to finish my typing my line. I can also use it if I want to add a line below ANYWHERE my cursor is it even the middle, the end, or the beginning. It has saved me many times from switching over to the arrow keys or finishing my line with typing evey specific character. Or shift + command + enter to enter a new line above. I use moderately.

1. Command search (> - 2:10) can be brought up with ctrl/cmd+shift+p
2. Current file symbols (@ - 2:45) can be brought up with ctrl/cmd+shift+o
3. Global workspace symbols (# - 3:15) can be brought up with ctrl/cmd+t
4. Want to open a file in a split panel? hold ctrl/cmd when you click on the file - this also works in the file search (ctrl/cmd+p)
5. Have two files in the file search you want to open - but dont want to ctrl/cmd+p and search again? instead of clicking / hitting enter on the file - use up/down to navigate, and use the right arrow key when the file is highlighted - this will keep the current search context open (tip 4 also works with this too)

switch between projects with CTRL + R - these ones I use most.

alt+Ctrl + Up/down arrows - kursory w pionie

ctrl+k+w to close all tabs.

One of my personal preferences is overriding the default ctrl+- and ctrl+= bindings which will change editor size to code folding and unfolding. You can do this by setting the shortcuts in preferences -> keyboard shortcuts. This is very handy in maintaining lengthy files

Improve your git lifestyle with "Git Graph" extension

Ctrl + Shift + O to search for symbols in the current file (variables, methods etc)
Ctrl + T to search for symbols globally

Use VSCode's Find in Files (CTRL + SHIFT + F) feature to perform a quick search in all the files in a folder

1. Ctrl + \ to create the copy of a code file -> helpful when we're working on a big code file and don't want to scroll too much.

2. Shift + alt + rightArrrow to mark the whole code inside the brackets -> now never use the mouse to select the code or text inside the bracket.😎

3.Ctrl + Shift + \ to move fast between start and end of the brackets .

1. Move between tabs: cmd + option + → or ←
2. Go back and forth to the saved cursor positions: go back: control + "-" go forward: control + shift + "-"
3. Open problems (really helpful with debugging errors): cmd + shift + m
4. Search everywhere: cmd + shift + f
5. Change language, useful when opening a new file (cmd + n) without without saving it: cmd + shift + p then type "CL" or in long: "change language" and select the desired language from the dropdown
6. All the Git commands: cmd + shift + p then type git and you will see a dropdown with all the options
7. Close the left menu tab (file explorer): cmd + b
8. Multiple cursors based on the position of the cursor (useful for changing multiple rows with different values): cmd + option + ⬆ or ⬇
9. Search and replace in the same file: wrap a word with shift then press f12 change the word and press enter
10.   Remove suggestions from GitLense or other extenstions (cleaned code view): cmd + shift + p then search "TZM" or in long: "toggle zen mode"

You could use F12 for renaming every occurrence of a symbol

highlight a specific keyword then "CTRL + F2" to select every keyword

When opening a large json/js file press ctrl+k then ctrl+0 to collapse/close every open tree {}.
Ctrl + b to toggle side bar.

F1 opens commands```````
F2 renames all instances in scope of a thingy wherever you have selected

CTRL + 1 to focus on code quickly.
CTRL + ` to focus on terminal
CTRL + b to toggle sidebar
CTRL + Alt + b to toggle sidebar icons

Zen mode: Ctrl+K Z

If you have a bunch of tabs open, you can use web browser-like shortcuts to navigate between them.
Ctrl + PageUp / PageDown = switch to next / previous tab
Ctrl + W = close tab
Ctrl + Shift + T = reopen previously closed tab
Other stuff I use:
Ctrl + Alt + → = split editor right (by moving the active tab)
Ctrl + Alt + ← = moving editor from right to left (if split vertically)
If you are using a split editor, you can swap with Ctrl + n (where n = 1,2,...) between the visible ones.
I also like to add a custom shortcut for focusing on the terminal.

Ctrl +\ to split the current window.

Alt + arrow left/right for quick navigating between last line you visited

Ctrl + Shift + F = Global find
Ctrl + Shift + H = Global replace
Ctrl + Shift + P = Command pallete

Ctrl + shift + ` adds another terminal window :)

Ctrl + Shift + P or F1 so you don’t have to write > in the command pallet

CTRL Shift .

Ctrl + P to open files and Ctrl + W to close them.

a couple more: Ctrl + Del deletes word by word, Shift + Del deletes line by line

Ctrl+shift+f to find in all files.
Ctrl+b to hide the distracting sidebar
Ctrl+x to see extensions

1. Ctrl + W -> To close the current file.
2. Ctrl + Shift + T -> Open the last closed file.

Ctrl + L will save me so much time.

Ctrl [ and Ctrl ] to indent/dedent.

mine is alt+up and down

shift + alt + a = block comment
